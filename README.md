Beebwatch face for Pebble smartwatch

This code is hacked together from a number of sources, most notably the
Pebble SDK examples; and https://github.com/dansl/pebble-silly-walk
(for examples of image rotation)

The code's a bit of a mess, but once the SDK settles down and is a bit
better documented, I'll probably rework this code to match. Until then,
my apologies: my code's not usually this messy.

I haven't tested it for battery performance yet.

Copyright on the BBC Clock face design is probably held by the BBC,
although I've redrawn it from scratch. Copyright on the fonts is held
by me (Tom Gidden), but is based on the characters generated by the
Mullard SAA5050 chip as used in Teletext.
